Nclusive Scan Accessibility Model v1.0 Overview

Description:
Nclusive Scan Accessibility Model v1.0 converts healthcare and enterprise documents into multimodal accessible formats—ASL avatar video, simplified text, closed captions, and synthesized audio—and packages them into an accessible MP4 output.

Developed by Nclusive Scan, in partnership with Cone Health Ventures, the system uses NVIDIA NeMo for text processing/simplification, NVIDIA Riva for ASR/TTS, and an internal text-to-gesture model integrated with NVIDIA Omniverse and Audio2Face for avatar animation and rendering. This model is ready for commercial use.

Third-Party Community Consideration
This model is not owned or developed by NVIDIA. It was built using NVIDIA frameworks to Nclusive Scan’s accessibility requirements.

License/Terms of Use:
Enterprise subscription, subject to Nclusive Scan’s licensing terms.

Deployment Geography:
Global, with initial deployment in North America (NAM).

Use Case:
Patients, caregivers, and providers access healthcare instructions in ASL video, simplified text, audio, and captions.

Release Date:
TBD
Other channels: Pending
