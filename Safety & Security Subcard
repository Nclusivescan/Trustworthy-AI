Model Application Field(s):                               |  Healthcare; Customer Service; Media & Entertainment (secondary, e.g., accessible media conversion); government. 
Describe the life critical impact (if present).   |  This model may be used in clinical contexts to convert patient discharge instructions, consent forms, or medication guides into accessible formats (ASL, simplified text, audio). 90% of American adults do not understand their health information. Even fewer disabled individuals understand their health information. To mitigate, Nclusive Scan is required for life-critical documents.
(For GPAI Models): Description of methods implemented in data acquisition or processing, if any, to address other types of potentially harmful data in the training, testing, and validation data: | Data pipelines employed filtering to exclude harmful or inappropriate material such as hate speech, harassment, weapon references, or violent content. Filtering was accomplished using NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails, keyword and regex scans, and human reviewer audits for sensitive datasets. Training corpora were stratified to exclude potentially stigmatizing language in healthcare contexts, and medical/educational texts were curated from trusted sources (Cone Health, NIH/NLM). Interpreter-verified ASL data was reviewed to avoid offensive or culturally inappropriate signing. Synthetic ASL avatars generated in NVIDIA Omniverse were validated against healthcare accessibility standards to ensure safety and cultural appropriateness. Continuous audits occur before release and during retraining cycles to maintain compliance.
(For GPAI Models): A description of any methods implemented in data acquisition or processing, if any, to address illegal or harmful content in the training data, including, but not limited to, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) | All datasets were scanned with automated filters (NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails + open-source CSAM detection lists) to detect and block illegal or harmful content. Any flagged data was removed and replaced with verified safe synthetic or de-identified alternatives. No CSAM, NCII, or comparable categories were identified in training or validation corpora.
Use Case Restrictions:                              |  Abide by Abide by Nclusive Scan Enterprise License Agreement.
Model and dataset restrictions:            |  The model may not be used to generate, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI) without a HIPAA-compliant environment. It must not be used for surveillance, profiling, or other non-accessibility purposes. Datasets are restricted to de-identified, publicly available, or licensed corpora; redistribution is prohibited.
