Generatable or reverse engineerable personal data?                                                                                 |  None — the model does not generate or reverse-engineer personal data.
Personal data used to create this model? Yes (If "None" or "None Known," Remove "Not Applicable" Fields Below)                     |  None known.
Was consent obtained for any personal data used?                                                                                   |  Not applicable — no identifiable personal data included.
(For GPAI Models): A description of any methods implemented in data acquisition or processing, if any, to address the prevalence of personal data in the training data, where relevant and applicable. | Model will be trained on Nclusive Scan's own library of ASL vidoes along with publicly available ASL videos. 
How often is dataset reviewed?                                                                                                     |  During dataset creation, model training, evaluation, and before release.
Is a mechanism in place to honor data subject right of access or deletion of personal data?                                        |  No personal data is collected at this time.
If personal data was collected for the development of the model, was it collected directly by Nclusive Scan?          |  Not applicable — no personal data collected. 
If personal data was collected for the development of the model by Nclusive Scan, do you maintain or have access to disclosures made to data subjects?  |  Not Applicable
If personal data was collected for the development of this AI model, was it minimized to only what was required?                   |  Not Applicable
Is there provenance for all datasets used in training?                                                                             |  Yes — all datasets are documented, version-controlled, and linked to internal data governance records.
Does data labeling (annotation, metadata) comply with privacy laws?                                                                |  Yes
Is data compliant with data subject requests for data correction or removal, if such a request was made?                           |  Yes — corrections or removals can be applied to internal datasets; updates are propagated to downstream training/validation sets.
Applicable Privacy Policy                                                                                                          | Nclusive Scan Privacy Policy, aligned with Cone Health HIPAA requirements and NVIDIA partner compliance frameworks.
(For GPAI Models): During AI model development, strict adherence to copyright policy ensured compliance through risk mitigation and legal reviews. Post-data collection, reserved rights content was identified and removed, with verified opt-out processes for rightsholders. Detailed records document due diligence and transparency.
(For GPAI Models): We employ automated tools and data processing techniques to scan for PII categories such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and medical identifiers. Scans of Cone Health de-identified datasets and NIH/NLM simplified text detected no PII. NVIDIA Clara NLP + NeMo Guardrails flagged a small number of potential PHI terms (e.g., hospital location names), which were removed or replaced using validated de-identification scripts.
